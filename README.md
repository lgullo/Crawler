# Crawler
The crawler is a java app I developed during my sophomore year of college for one of our programming projects. The crawler starts at a given URL, pulls in the html text from the page and parses it for emails, as well as parses for "href" properties to build an on-going list of URL's for the crawler to continue crawling/parsing through.
